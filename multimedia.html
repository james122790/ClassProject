                     <td>2. Do not pack for "what ifs"! Your just going to overpack , and I know you have a million possiblities of things that could happen but trust me. Only pack the bare essentials and absolute necessities.</td>

                     <td>3. Roll your clothes instead of folding. When I started rolling my clothes I almost doubled the space in my luggage. You don't have to be perfect at rolling to get the most out of this method either, even a messy roll makes your clothes much more compact. </td>
