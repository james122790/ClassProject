      <p>England has offered me the opportunity to travel around Europe, and thanks to <a href="https://www.skyscanner.net/">Skyscanner</a> I can find flights out of London for a relatively cheap price. I've flown to Spain and Italy for less than $100 for myself, my wife, and my son. We've tried our hand at taking the ferry into mainland Europe as well when we spent Thanksgiving in Amsterdam. We drove to Dover, England and took a ferry to Dunkirk, France. Once there it was a 4 hour drive up to the city of Zandvoorf where we stayed, which was a 15 minute train ride to Amsterdam.</p>
            <br>
       <p>It also offers us the chance to see what England has to offer as well. We've visited the west to see Stonehenge and the city of Bathe. We've gone down south and saw the White Cliffs of Dover, along with the city of Brighton, and we've traveled out East to Horsey Beach and the city of Norwich.

            <h1> Where to Stay?</h1>
      <p>Whenever we travel we find the best places to stay by using <a href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/">Airbnb</a>. If you've never stayed at an Airbnb I would highly recommend it. You can thouroughly review any place your going to stay and it's always much more personal and cheaper than just staying in a hotel. While we were in Italy we were served fresh baked bread every morning, delivered straight to our door, and they really made us feel at home. Even our first week in London we spent 2 nights in someones guest house, they offered to babysit(we didn't take them up on that offer) and gave us some great places to see throughout this city.</p

            <h1> What to do?</h1>
      <p>Have you ever traveled somewhere and not known what you were going to do on you trip? Well Airbnb has that covered as well with <a href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/s/experiences/">Airbnb Experiences</a>. We personally used this feature while traveling to Majora, Spain. It's a small island off the coast that was a big tourist attraction and we decided to go their for a cheap holiday during the summer. Once we were there we wanted to try and find something more personal then just touring the island with other large groups. Using Airbnb experience we were able to find a local that gave tours around the island on an old fishing boat he refurbished. He took us to a beach that was accesible only by boat and served us lunch using local cuisine from his parents farm. I would recommend giving it a try even in your own cit, you never know what you could be missing.</p>

            <h2> Places to See </h2>
      <p> There are still so many places I want to visit while I'm here and so little time to see it all. The one place I want to go the most before I leave is <a href="https://www.lochness.com/">Loch Ness</a> in Scotland and find the one and only Lock Ness Monster, "Nessie". One can hope.<p>
