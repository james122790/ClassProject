<h1> Welcome to my first ever webpage </h1>

<p> My name is James Sparks, I was born in New Jersey way back in 1990 and my 30's are only a couple a months a way. I grew up in a military family and as a young child had the privilege to live in Italy where I became fluent in Italian at the age of five. Sadly, no one else in my family could speak it so once we got back to the states I quickly lost it. After that we moved to Alabama where my dad retire in near by Fort Benning, GA, where i lived until I joined the Air Force</p>
